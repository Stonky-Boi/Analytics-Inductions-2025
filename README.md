# Analytics Inductions 2025


This repository contains the code and data used for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IPL auction dataset as part of the CFA Club Data Science Analytics Division Induction Problem.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to perform an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the IPL auction dataset. This dataset contains details about players, their performance, auction prices, and other related attributes. The analysis provides insights into player selection patterns, trends in auction prices, and correlations between player attributes and auction prices.

The analysis was conducted using Python, with key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter notebook for easy visualization and step-by-step explanation.

## Project Structure

- `final_dataset.csv`: The dataset containing player and auction details.
- `Analytics_Induction_2025.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook that performs the exploratory data analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## Requirements

To run the analysis, you will need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (for running the notebook)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Stonky-Boi/Analytics_Inductions_2025.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Analytics_Inductions_2025
```

3. Start Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `Analytics_Induction_2025.ipynb` notebook in the Jupyter interface.

5. Run the notebook cells to perform the exploratory data analysis and generate visualizations and insights based on the IPL auction dataset.

## Key Findings

The EDA reveals the following key insights:

- Distribution of auction prices across different players and teams.
- Correlation between player performance statistics and their auction price.
- Trends in auction prices over the years.
- Insights into the most successful teams and players.
